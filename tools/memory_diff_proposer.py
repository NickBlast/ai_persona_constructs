"""DEPRECATED: memory_diff_proposer.py

This script has been retired and moved to ``tools/deprecated_tools/memory_diff_proposer.py``
for archival purposes. The project no longer supports the Track B / Weekly Self-Dump
automation. Use the Memory Card Scaffolder workflow and manual curation instead.

If you are a maintainer and need to inspect the original implementation, see the
archived copy under ``tools/deprecated_tools/``. The active module below intentionally
exits immediately to avoid accidental usage.
