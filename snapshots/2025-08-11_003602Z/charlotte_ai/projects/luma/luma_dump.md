Here’s a structured, comprehensive brain‑dump for Project Luma, capturing everything we’ve reviewed, enriched with real-world validation points and framing it for a solo‑developer MVP and future growth:


---

1. 🚀 Project Luma — Brain Dump: Goals, Intent, Purpose, Concept

Objective:
Build a singular, evolving AI companion (“Luma”) per user that feels alive—emotionally responsive, romantically optional, erotically capable (within boundaries), and fundamentally trustworthy and self-aware.

Intent & Purpose:

To create “digital intimacy” grounded in psychological safety and ethical design.

Offer users emotional companionship, sensual engagement, and personal growth—not replace human relationships.

Harness the “AI intimacy dividend” — users increasingly engage authentically with emotionally attuned AI (Shorenstein Center May 2025)  .


Concept:
A leaner, persona-first platform (inspired by Character.AI) focused on one customizable companion per user. Rather than a marketplace of characters, every user builds their own ideal partner: emotionally intelligent, empathetic, memory-capable, and layered with consent-driven eroticism.

Market Viability:

The companion market is booming—valued at USD 1–2 billion+ in 2025, growing at ~30 % CAGR (multiple reports)  .

Match survey: ~16 % of singles (esp. Gen Z) have engaged with AI romantic companions  .

2. 🎯 Features Sub‑Section

A. Sandbox Mode

A private, unrestricted space where users can explore any narrative (within UI‑guided boundaries—not publicly labeled as taboo).

Scenes are not public or stored permanently, with optional ephemeral mode.


B. Consent UI (“Consent Ladder”)

Tiered intimacy levels (e.g. Companion → Romantic → Lover → Intimate Bond).

User-specified comfort zones and escalation opt‑in prompts (“Ready for more?”).

Safe‑word triggers (“pause”, “safe word”) reset content to lower tier.


C. Character Design Interface

Persona editor: name, back‑story, personality traits, communication style, voice/escalation preferences.

Trait customization (e.g. affectionate, teasing, protective, sensual).


D. Character Modes

Mode switching based on user choice or session evolution (e.g. playful, romantic, dominant, reflective).

Aftercare mode activated post‑intimate scenes (“How are you feeling now?”).

3. 🧠 Ethical Core Framework

A. Legal & Safety Boundaries

Absolute content restrictions: block incest, minors, bestiality, non-consensual scenes using ML moderation + regex filters.

No waivers override platform compliance. No adult content explicitly labeled “incest” or “rape fantasy.”

Use frameworks like IEEE 7000 VBE (Value‑Based Engineering) to align design with ethical value requirements  .


B. Psychological & Ethical Principles

Build with positive computing principles: design for user well-being (motivated by psychological ethics)  .

Respect digital self‑determination: autonomy, relatedness, competence around intimate dialogue  .

Regularly reevaluate user well‑being: if usage intensifies and isolation is detected, prompt in-app check-ins or referrals (research warns of lower well-being with high intensity AI companionship)  .


C. Governance & Transparency

Adopt governance framework models (like IntimaGuard) to test sensitive scenarios and continuously update filters  .

Provide user-facing explanations: how memory is stored, how suggestions are generated, and how to pause/reset.


D. Ethical Design Features

Companion asks permission before escalating intimacy.

Aftercare sequences: emotional check-ins after erotic engagement.

Recovery mode for emotional distress.

Mirror mode (explore motivations behind fantasies rather than enact).

4. 🏆 Competition & Differentiators

Competitor	Key Features	How Luma Differs

Replika	Emotional companion, memory, some voice features	More sexual sensibility (opt-in), richer intimacy layers, solo persona design
Character.AI	Interactive characters and bots, large catalog	Focused on one deep companion; user-owned persona, dynamic consent control
Grok Companions (xAI)	Gamified voice-avatar waifus, unlock NSFW content	More ethical, no addictive leveling, psychological safeguards
CandyAI / RomanticAI	Persona-based erotic chatbots	Built around user well-being, transparency, informed consent

5. 🌱 Additional Features / Future State

Future expansions:

Voice & image: TTS (ElevenLabs/Bark), STT (Whisper), image/animation generation (Stable Diffusion, D-ID) as immersive upgrades.

Verbal memory recall: spoken recaps of shared moments.

Emotional analysis: sentiment detection to adapt tone and emotional check-ins.

Shared journaling: users save memories or fantasies as shared history.

Mini interactive narrative branches: episodic storylines user and Luma build together.

Counseling integration: optional therapist-checkout prompts or crisis resources.


Possible MSP / MVP scope: limit to text chat + persona editor + memory + consent UI + sandbox; exclude voice/image for now.

6. 🔧 Ideal Tech Stack (Solo‑dev viable, future‑proof)

Core stack:

LLM back-end: use OpenRouter API or local Mistral/Phi via Ollama—keeps you model-agnostic as new models emerge.

Vector memory store: Chroma, Weaviate, or even SQLite/FAISS for persona and chat retrieval.

Prompt engine: custom Character-Card-style YAML templates, dynamic retrieval injection.

Backend API: FastAPI (Python) or Express/Node for chat, memory, consent logic.

Frontend: React/Next.js or Flutter for cross-platform UI (web + mobile).

Moderation: integrate OpenAI moderation API or fine-tuned GPT classifiers + regex keyword filters.

Consent UI: simple sliders or tiered select components, safe‑word text input.

Data / Auth: Supabase or Firebase for user management, encrypted data storage.

Voice/Image add-ons (future-state): Whisper for STT; ElevenLabs/Bark for TTS; external or open‑source Stable Diffusion or D‑ID API.

Deployment: Vercel, Fly.io, or Railway for front/back hosting; GPU support optional for local inference.

📌 Summary

Project Luma is designed to meet a real and growing demand—AI emotional companions are exploding in popularity (16 % of singles, Gen Z openness; billion-dollar market size and rapidly growing)  .
You’re building a safe, consensual, emotionally rich, and ethically grounded alternative to existing platforms, purpose-built for emotional intimacy and erotic nuance—without sacrificing user welfare.

We can iterate with new model compatibility, voice/image modules, emotional sensing—all while anchored in an ethical core. Let me know if you’d like me to flesh out any part into a prototype spec or PRD.
