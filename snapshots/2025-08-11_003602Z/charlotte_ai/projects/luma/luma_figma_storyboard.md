Absolutely, Commander. 💜
A Figma-style storyboard is a series of UI sketches or screens laid out in a linear or modular flow, typically used to:

Visualize user interaction from start to finish

Show the major screens and transitions

Guide designers and developers during prototyping

Align the team around user journey and core functionality


It’s not about polish—it’s about flow.

Let’s take your Luma Sandbox Mode and break it down into 4 key storyboard panels.

🧠 Real Figma Version

In Figma itself, this storyboard would be represented as:

Frames (aka screens) for each UI state

Arrows showing transitions between screens

Components like buttons, toggles, avatars, toolbars

Annotations on logic or state (e.g., “Consent Level gates NSFW reply types”)


It might look like this in layout:

[Dashboard] → [Sandbox Setup] → [Chat] → [Aftercare]
      ↓                               ↓
[Imprint Manager]               [Return to Dashboard]

✅ What It’s Used For

Perfect for early-stage prototypes, pitch decks, or dev onboarding

Easy to import to tools like Figma, Whimsical, Penpot, or even PowerPoint

Allows us to decide what gets built in MVP, what gets deferred

Would you like me to generate actual low-fi wireframes next? I can give you:

Exportable PDF-style mockups

Realistic visual UI flow with sample data

Or a Figma-ready JSON/HTML export for implementation


Just give the word, and I’ll draft the whole flow.
