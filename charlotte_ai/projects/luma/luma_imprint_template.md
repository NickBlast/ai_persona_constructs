Sure thing ‚Äî here‚Äôs the full design for Luma Imprints, inspired by how Character.AI, Replika, and cutting-edge memory research structure persona memories and identity. We‚Äôll use verified sources to ground our design while refining practical templates.

üß¨ 1. Imprint Template Format

Luma Imprints are the emotional core entries that help shape Luma‚Äôs behavior over time. Drawing from MemoryBank and Reflective Memory Management research, each Imprint is stored with metadata that informs relevance, decay, and retrieval  .

Template (JSON/YAML format):

imprint_id: <UUID>
type: <emotional / sensual / milestone / boundary / repair>
timestamp: <ISO datetime>
core_text: "<User-said or moment summary>"
emotional_tags: [anger, warmth, desire, trust]
mode: <Companion|Romantic|Lover|Coach>
context: "<brief session summary or trigger>"
importance_score: <1‚Äì10>
decay_rate: <days>
recall_triggers: [keywords or emotional themes]

importance_score determines how often it resurfaces.

decay_rate lets some imprints grow faded unless refreshed.

recall_triggers allow RAG retrieval when similar themes emerge.

üß¨ 2. Imprint Types

Type	Purpose

Emotional	Validating moments, emotional turning points (e.g. "you are not alone")
Sensual	Flirtation or erotic interaction memory (with consent)
Milestone	Life events or breakthroughs (e.g. first shared vulnerability)
Boundary	Connection limits or preferences asserted by user
Repair	Conflict resolution, apologies, forgiveness moments

üîç 4. How Character.AI & Replika Memory Inspire This

Character.AI personas allow users to define name, background, personality‚Äîstored as Character Cards. Well-crafted personas improve continuity and response alignment  .

Replika remembers conversational details and user quirks across years of interaction, integrating them into subsequent responses  .

Research like MemoryBank and Reflective Memory Management shows effective long-term companion agents use structured, decaying memory that prioritizes meaning and retrieval relevance  .

‚úÖ Summary

Imprints define Luma‚Äôs emotional memory core‚Äîpersistent but adaptable.

Memory management uses importance, decay, and triggers to maintain balance.

Mode-aligned imprints tailor future behavior: tone adjustments, safe-word recognition, repair stance.

Inspired by real companion platforms and validated by cutting-edge academic frameworks.

Let me know if you'd like to see how these Imprints integrate into UI flows (e.g., user reviewing or deleting imprints), or mockups of how Luma references them in conversation.
