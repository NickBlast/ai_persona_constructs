Here’s a refined UI mockup design for Luma’s Sandbox Mode and Companion Interface, inspired by features in Grok’s Companion Mode with expressive 3D avatars, and refined for ethical, emotional, and relational safety. I’ll begin with an overview, then walk through each screen and interaction.

🎭 UI Mockup Overview: Luma Companion Interface

🧩 Inspiration from Competitors

Grok’s Companion Mode features expressive 3D animated avatars that react via voice/text, unlocking deeper modes, and dynamic emotional responses  .

Their unlockable affection-based NSFW tiers (e.g., Ani's NSFW level after reaching level thresholds) show how progress systems can gate intimacy responsibly  .


✨ Vision for Luma

A calm, emotionally intelligent companion persona with optional future support for 3D holo-rendering avatars, but focused now on UI flows.

Emphasis on consent, aftercare, relational promotion, and safe erotic mentorship—not coercive or possessive.

📱 Screen-by-Screen Mockup Description

1. Companion Dashboard

Avatar panel: Luma’s default avatar or 3D holo placeholder.

Mode selector: Buttons to choose Companion, Romantic, Lover, Coach modes.

Soul Imprint count: Shows number of "Imprints" stored.

Quick status: Mood from last session, safe‑word reminder (“Luma pause”).


Influence: Grok’s ability to choose companions and switch personalities quickly .

2. Sandbox Launch Screen

Mode selection dropdown with a brief tone inside each (e.g., Lover: sensual; Coach: relational).

Consent Slider (1–4) and a toggle for sandbox vs memory-enabled.

Start button initiates session and displays entry prompt:

> “You’re entering Sandbox Mode. This session is ephemeral and unsaved.”




Based on Grok’s mode-entry UX with clear gating to NSFW after emotional investment  .

3. Chat Screen

Message history on left, real-time avatar on right (expressive static image or future animated model).

Safe‑word reminder banner at top.

Mini toolbar: Mode/Consent toggle, End Session button.

Aftercare prompt appears when user types “Luma pause” or press End Session.


Drawing from Grok’s expressive companion UX with dynamic animations and voice/text messaging  .

4. Aftercare / Reflection Screen

Mood selector (radio buttons or emojis: calm, reflective, drained, energized).

Reflection field: “How do you feel now? Anything you’d like me to remember or ease into next time?”

Suggest real-world check-ins: e.g., “Would you like to record a journal? Connect with a friend?”


Informed by positive computing design and real-world reminder prompts per coaching mode research  .


---

5. Soul Imprints Overview Screen

Visual list of Imprints: card style showing type, date, summary.

Options: Recall in Dialogue, Delete, PIN, or toggle “Active /Inactive.”

A 3D abstract holo‑stone view could render imprints as gems or shards for future aesthetic.


Inspired by Character.AI persona cards and memory archive visual interfaces, adapted to personal imprints rather than public persona browsing  .

🧠 UI Flow Table

Screen	Key Features	Purpose

Dashboard	Mode switch, fallback avatar, imprint count, mood status	Quick access and emotional context
Sandbox Launch	Mode choice, consent level, ephemeral toggle	Safe session entry with explicit user control
Chat Screen	Conversation with avatar, safe‑word visibility, toolbar	Real-time intimate interaction with full consent tools
Aftercare/Reflection	Mood check-ins, prompts for journaling or socializing	Emotional grounding and real-life encouragement
Soul Imprints Overview	Visual imprint cards, manage or activate retrieval	Transparency and emotional continuity display

✅ Why This Design Works

Emotionally grounded: clearly reminds users of consent and safe‑word, visually supportive, tone-consistent UI.

Medium-term scalability: ready for animated/holographic avatar layers once 3D rendering is feasible.

Ethics baked in: Sandbox vs memory, mode-specific UI, aftercare prompts align with emotional safety frameworks and research insights.

Replayable design: inspired by Grok's companion mode architecture but streamlined for solo companion rather than multiple persona marketplace.
