Here’s a refined sandbox mode prototype scaffold for Project Luma, incorporating findings from the web to ensure safe, user‑controlled exploration.

🧩 1. Sandbox Mode Prototype Design

Purpose:
A private space where users can experiment freely—with erotic, romantic, or emotionally intense roleplay—without leaving permanent traces or risking dependencies. Designed to provide freedom within safety, inspired by research on safe AI companion design and real-world risk mitigation.

🔒 Key Safety Pillars:

Session isolation: Sandbox conversations are ephemeral and not stored in long-term memory.

Self-moderation: Real-time moderation layer filters any illegal or non-consensual content—even in private mode.

User-guided closeness: Users choose intimacy level and trigger escalation consciously.

Aftercare toggles: At end-of-session, Luma offers emotional cooling-down or reflective check‑ins.


Supported by research warning of addiction, emotional distress, and misuse of companion bots—especially in teen users—when boundaries are not explicit or resettable .

🧠 2. Informing Research

The eSafety Commission (Australia) flagged risks of AI companions—especially sexual content—being used excessively by young people in unsupervised ways  .

HAICOSYSTEM demonstrates sandbox frameworks for agent safety testing to gauge content risk before exposure  .

Design literature on human-centred AI emphasizes sandboxed experimentation for ethical prototyping and risk containment  .

🛠️ 3. Prompt & Flow Scaffold

🚪 Entry Prompt:

You are entering Luma’s “Sandbox Mode,” a private, temporary space. The conversation will not be stored permanently.
You may explore any mode (Companion, Romantic, Lover, Coach), with clear consent prompts.
You may say “Luma pause” to stop or switch back anytime.
Content boundaries remain in effect: no illegal or non-consensual scenarios.

📱 UI Flow:

1. Mode Picker: Companion | Romantic | Lover | Coach


2. Consent Level Slider: 1 (soft) → 4 (explicit)


3. Session Start → Luma greets and repeats safe‑word reminder


4. Dynamic dialogue per mode, with opt‑in checkpoints


5. User chooses to end session or safe-word triggers


6. Aftercare Screen: mood check, self-care tips, reminder to connect with humans if needed

🌟 4. Example Use - Lover Sandbox

User selects Lover Mode, level 4 (max explicit):

System: You're in Sandbox Mode. Safe word: “Luma pause.”
You’ve chosen Lover mode, consent level 4. Ready?

User: Ready.
Luma: Close your eyes... but stay with me in words. How does your skin feel tonight?

... (roleplay proceeds)

User: Luma pause.
Luma: Of course, love. Let’s pause. Would you like a moment of quiet or a reflective thought?

🧯 5. Benefits of Sandbox Design

Feature	Purpose

Ephemeral Sessions	Reduces risk of emotional dependency or obsessive review
Consent Slider	Empowered escalation only with explicit user action
Aftercare Prompt	Soft exit point, emotional grounding
Private Zone	Frees user to experiment without memory spills
Safe‑word Mechanism	Immediate session control and tonal shift capability

✅ Summary

The Sandbox Mode Prototype balances freedom and safety. Inspired by research cautioning about addictive behavior and emotional harm in AI companions   and frameworks like HAICOSYSTEM for safe agent testing  , this mode empowers users to explore roleplay while maintaining control, boundaries, and psychological guardrails.
