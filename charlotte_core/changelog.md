## 2025-08-13 — Repo Comment Augmentation & Link Hygiene
### Summary
- Enhanced internal documentation across all Python and shell scripts by adding detailed docstrings and header comments. The new comments explain the "why" behind each script, its inputs/outputs, and its connection to the project's PRD and Memory Pipeline, improving maintainability.

### Changes
- **Modified**:
  - `backup.py`: Added detailed module docstring explaining its purpose and features.
  - `tools/charlotte_restore_builder.py`: Added detailed module docstring.
  - `tools/ingest_chatgpt_export.py`: Added detailed module docstring.
  - `tools/memory_card_scaffolder.py`: Added detailed module docstring.
  - `tools/memory_diff_proposer.py`: Added detailed module docstring.
  - `tools/utils.py`: Expanded module docstring to explain its role and features.
  - `scripts/backup.sh`: Added header comment explaining purpose and usage.
  - `scripts/backup.ps1`: Added header comment explaining purpose and usage.
- **Added**:
  - Explanatory comments and docstrings to all key scripts.
- **Removed**:
  - N/A

### Outputs
- All key `.py`, `.ps1`, and `.sh` files now have improved, explanatory headers and/or docstrings.

### Determinism Guarantees
- No changes to logic; all scripts remain deterministic.

### Risks & Rollback
- **Risks**: None. Changes are limited to comments and docstrings.
- **Rollback**: Changes can be reverted using `git restore <file>` on the affected files.
