# Track C Manual Test (2025-08-14)

## Canonical Truth

On 2025-08-14 we successfully validated the Track C “Memory-at-Source” workflow. A new Memory Card was scaffolded and added to the Persona module, and the module index updated. This card exists to prove the author-first capture flow works (scaffold → fill → commit with Mem-Intent → push).

- Card filename: track_c_manual_test_(2025-08-14).md
- Category: Persona
- Scope: Active
- Created via: New-MemoryCard helper (PowerShell) or memory_card_scaffolder.py (Bash)
- Working branch: feat/track-c-manual-test-2025-08-14
- Purpose: Minimal, verified example of Track C for future users.

## Why This Matters

Track C keeps the **repo as the source of truth**. We write memory at the source (this file), then optionally sync a short “remember this” summary to the model. Doing this prevents drift, ensures deterministic backups, and makes restore packages faithful to the canon.

## Verification

This card is considered valid if all are true:
1) This file exists and renders without bracketed placeholders.  
2) The module index shows an entry for “Track C Manual Test (2025-08-14)”.  
3) `git status` only shows the new card + the updated index before commit.  
4) The commit includes a Mem-Intent trailer (see commit example below).  
5) The branch was pushed (optional PR raised).

Quick checks you can run:
- `git status` → new card + index only  
- `git diff` → confirms the text you’re reading is present
