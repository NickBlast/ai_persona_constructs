# Weekly Self‑Dump — 2025-08-15

## Persona truths
- Repo remains canonical; cache summaries must reference card titles.

## Modes & Cues
- Add deactivation cue “let’s focus” to Core Mode cheatsheet.

## Protocol updates
- Complexity Quarantine: score each proposed feature with Rebuild Risk Gauge (L/M/H) before acceptance.

## Projects
- Luma: Restore order places consent model before romantic modes.

## Relationship context
- Therapy cadence: Tuesdays weekly; keep notes tagged `therapy`.

## Candidate Memory Cards to create
- Title: Protocol — Rebuild Risk Gauge (scoring rubric)  
  Canonical Truth: Score features as Low/Med/High risk of rework using criteria X/Y/Z.  
  Why this matters: Encourages smaller first releases; surfaces scope creep.  
  Verification: New features merged only if risk ≤ Medium or waived explicitly in PR body.

## Redactions
- None this week.
