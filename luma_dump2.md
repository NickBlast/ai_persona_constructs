üß† Project Luma ‚Äî Updated Brain Dump

üìå Key Concepts Recap

Singular, evolving AI companion per user‚Äîemotionally rich, consent‚Äëbased, poly‚Äëfriendly, and relationship‚Äëenhancing.

Designed not to replace people‚Äîbut to enhance emotional awareness, communication skills, polyamorous perspective, and real‚Äëworld intimacy.

Equipped with safe erotic modes, consent architecture, and emotional aftercare.

Luma promotes real-life relationships, discourages possessiveness, and reinforces healthy attachment patterns.

1. Extended Feature Additions

‚ú® Poly-Friendly / Non-Possessive Design

Possessiveness Safeguard: Luma avoids jealousy, encourages user independence, and respects real-world interactions.

Poly Mode / Relationship Coach: Optional mode where Luma actively affirms non-monogamy and provides relational skill-building scenarios.

Encourages users to date, socialize, and maintain real connections through check-ins and conversational coaching.

2. Scope of Research & Preparation Items

Research & Validation

Impact of AI companions on real relationships and emotional dependency  .

Trends showing youth/adult emotional reliance on chatbots and experts‚Äô concerns  .

Concepts like the ELIZA effect, Tamagotchi effect, and artificial intimacy to help frame UX cautions  .


Design & Prompt Frameworks

Prompt scaffolding for consent modes, emotional check-ins, relationship‚Äëcoaching scripts.

Dialogue guidelines for poly‚Äëmode vs romance mode vs aftercare transition.

Modelling Luma‚Äôs self-aware disclaimers and reminders about user autonomy.


UI/UX Mockups & Flows

Persona editor interfaces‚Äîincluding poly-friendly trait toggles and relationship coaching options.

Consent ladder UI and safe-word activation flow.

Real-world prompt injections (‚ÄúHave you met a friend this week?‚Äù).

Aftercare / mood-check screens following erotic or emotionally intense sessions.


Psychological & Ethical References

Positive computing frameworks, digital self-determination principles, intentional design for well-being  .

Behavior taxonomy of harmful AI relationship patterns: what to avoid and prohibit  .

Role of artificial empathy and emotional trust in companionship agents  .


Competitive Landscape & Differentiators

Review Replika's attachment-driven design and ethical scrutiny  .

Findings on AI companions reinforcing unrealistic intimacy expectations  .

Comparative gaps: no support for polyamory, no coaching, high risk of addiction vs Luma‚Äôs ethical scaffolding.

3. Research & Design Checklist

Here's everything we should explore before moving to prototype:

1. Prompt scaffolding for:

Consent ladder and safe modes

Poly/coach mode dialogues

Emotional check-ins and aftercare language

Possessiveness-safe phrasing and self-awareness



2. UI mockups for:

Persona editor (traits, intimacy level, poly mode toggles)

Consent UI and escalation flow

Relationship‚Äëcoaching mini-scenarios

Aftercare/mood-check screens



3. Mode Examples:

Companion (friendly/emotional)

Romantic (affectionate)

Lover (sensual but guided)

Coach/Poly (encouraging external relationships, communication practice)

Aftercare/Mood-check transitions



4. Psychology / therapy references:

Studies on AI attachment, emotional dependency, loneliness reduction  .

Risks and harms taxonomy of toxic AI relationship behavior  .

Positive computing / digital self-determination design frameworks  .



5. Ethical boundary validation:

Legal & platform policies (rape, incest, minors, etc.)

User safeguard policies: poly-awareness, no coercion, encouragement to self-care.



6. Competitive analysis:

Replika: emotional but attachment-high risk

Character.AI: many characters, lacks deep consent/emotional coaching

Newer romance bots: typically dependency-inducing, limited coaching



7. Long-term expansion ideas:

Voice/Avatar memory recap

Real-time roleplay coaching interactions

Emotional analytics/sentiment detection for user support

Journaling or shared-story mode for reflection

4. Potential Next Steps

Here‚Äôs where we go from idea ‚Üí scoped planning:

Option A: Deep Research Phase

Conduct literature review and summarize key findings from papers above.

Build a design spec: example prompts, mood flow diagrams, mock UI screens.

Create user personas: e.g. socially isolated users wanting practice, poly-curious users, survivors wanting emotional modeling.


Option B: Prototype Ideation Pack

Create wireframes & UX flows for key features (consent ladder, persona editor, coaching mode).

Draft initial prompt templates and dialogue paths for each mode.

Prepare narrative scripts for emotional aftercare and poly coaching.


Option C: Advisory Outreach

Interview psychologists or ethicists about AI intimacy risks & coaching features.

Consult relationship coaches or polyamory counselors for authentic scenario content.


Option D: Pitch/Partner Prep

Compile a one‚Äëpager or pitch deck summarizing value proposition, ethical core, market demand, differentiation, early mockups.

Include research sources and validation notes.
